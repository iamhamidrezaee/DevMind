# 🧠 DevMind: AI Team Memory Oracle

**🏆 Submission for Agents & MCP Hackathon 2025 - Track 3: Agentic Demo Showcase**

## 🎯 What is DevMind?

DevMind is an **intelligent development context oracle** that creates a living memory of your team's decisions, code changes, and discussions. Unlike traditional search tools, DevMind provides **predictive insights** and **visual knowledge graphs** to show how decisions cascade through your development process.

## 🚀 Key Innovations

### 1. 🧠 **Visual Knowledge Graphs**
See how code commits, architectural decisions, bug reports, and team discussions interconnect in an interactive network visualization.

### 2. 🔮 **Predictive Analytics**  
AI analyzes patterns across your development history to predict future issues before they become problems.

### 3. 📊 **Decision Impact Tracking**
Understand how past architectural choices and decisions are affecting current problems and future development.

### 4. 🤝 **Real-time Team Context**
Creates a collaborative memory that learns from your team's interactions across GitHub, Slack, Jira, and more.

### 5. ⚡ **Agentic Intelligence**
Goes beyond simple search - the AI autonomously connects dots across different data sources to provide insights you wouldn't find manually.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Context Gathering**: Integrates with GitHub (and other sources) to gather development context
2. **Pattern Analysis**: AI analyzes relationships between commits, issues, decisions, and discussions  
3. **Knowledge Graph**: Builds visual network showing how everything connects
4. **Predictive Insights**: Identifies patterns that indicate future problems or opportunities
5. **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides specific next steps based on analysis

## 🎯 Why This Wins Track 3

**Beyond Simple Tools**: Most development tools just search or display data. DevMind **predicts the future** and **shows hidden connections** that help teams make better decisions.

**Real Innovation**: 
- First tool to create visual knowledge graphs of development context
- Predictive analytics for development teams (not just reactive monitoring)
- Agentic AI that autonomously discovers insights across disparate data sources
- Shows decision impact chains that span months of development

**Practical Value**: Solves the $billion problem of context switching and institutional memory loss that every development team faces.

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Gradio 5 with custom CSS and interactive visualizations
- **AI Engine**: Claude Sonnet 4 for advanced reasoning and pattern recognition
- **Visualizations**: Plotly for interactive graphs, NetworkX for knowledge graphs
- **Integrations**: Real GitHub API integration (extensible to Slack, Jira, etc.)
- **Data Processing**: Intelligent context correlation and impact scoring

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Enter your Anthropic API key
2. Optionally provide a GitHub repository URL for real data
3. Ask questions like:
   - "What decisions led to our current authentication issues?"
   - "Show me how performance optimizations connect to user complaints"
   - "What patterns indicate future scaling problems?"

## 📊 Example Insights

- **Pattern Recognition**: "High bug frequency in authentication module suggests need for additional testing"
- **Decision Impact**: "JWT implementation decision is connected to current session persistence issues"
- **Predictive Analysis**: "Based on commit patterns, API performance will likely become bottleneck within 2 sprints"

## 🔧 Installation & Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Hugging Face Spaces
This app is designed for one-click deployment to Hugging Face Spaces. Simply upload the files and it will work automatically.

## 🏆 Competition Advantages

1. **Innovation**: First visual knowledge graph for development context
2. **Practical**: Solves real pain points every dev team has
3. **Scalable**: Architecture supports any team size and data volume  
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new data sources and analysis types
5. **Beautiful**: Modern, intuitive interface that developers actually want to use

## 🎯 Future Roadmap

- **Real-time Integration**: Live updates from Slack, Jira, GitHub webhooks
- **Team Analytics**: Multi-team insights and cross-project pattern recognition
- **Custom ML Models**: Train team-specific models for better predictions
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Plugins for VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.
